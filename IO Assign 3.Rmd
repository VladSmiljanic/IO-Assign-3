## Question 1

We can define our mean utility for the model to be :

\begin{align*}

\delta_{jt} = x_{jt}\beta - \alpha p_{jt} + \gamma m_j + \lambda c_t + \xi_{jt}
\end{align*}

Where $u_{ijt} = \delta_{jt}(x_{jt}, p_{jt},m_j, c_t,\xi;\beta,\alpha) + \epsilon_{ijt}$.


(From Berry 1994 paper page 6) Variation in consumer tastes only enters through the error term $\epsilon_{ijt}$ which is assumed to be iid extreme value or logit distribution across all consumers and choices. 

\begin{align*}
F(\delta_{0t}\dots\delta_{Jt}) = \exp(-\exp(-I))\\
\end{align*}

Where $I$ is inclusive value $\ln \sum^J_{k=0}\exp(\delta_k)$. Can interpret $I$ as the expected value of the maximum over all utilities.

As a result, all properties of market demand are determined by $\delta_{jt}$, which includes market shares and elasticities. As a result, cross-price elasticities only depend on $\delta_{jt}$ with no additional effect from product charasteristics and prices. Errors that are iid results in two pairs of goods (ie. cars) with the same market shares will have the same cross-price elasticity with a third good.
